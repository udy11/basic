# Function to find a root of a one
# dimensional function using False Position Method

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Call function falspos() with:
#   a,b = range in which root is to be found (inclusive)
#   er = tolerance below which root will be accepted,
#        i.e., when |f(c)|<er, c is accepted as root
# Define f(x), external function whose root is to be found
# Function falspos() outputs a tuple (istt, c), where
#   istt = status code of function's execution (see below for details)
#   c = found root

# STATUS CODE:
# istt=1, success: root found between a and b
# istt=2, success: root found at a
# istt=3, success: root found at b
# istt=-1, error: root could not be found between a and b

# NOTE:
# If f(x) does not cross the x-axis but only touches it,
#   like f(x)=x*x at x=0, then that root will most probably not be found
# Below method does not check for opposite signs to continue operating
#   as conventional false position method does, but it is then likely to
#   find a root if it exists, even if signs at boundaries are not opposite
# Method is optimized for minimum calls to f(x)
