# Function to get all permutations of a list (maximum 20)

# Permutations of list objects (max 20)
# Technique is to appropriately swap entries in input array
# Method self-discovered (hence many improvements will follow soon)

# In case some input are same, they will still be treated as distinct
# and their repeatation will be reflected in the output

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Call function perms_file with:
#   ofln, output file name
#   a as list of objects to be permuted

# The output is not sorted
# Program will become terribly slow for list size more than 9
