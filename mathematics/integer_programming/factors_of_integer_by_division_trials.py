# Function to get all factors of a positive
# integer using Trial Division method

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Call the function fctrs_tdm(n) with
# positive integer n, whose factors
# are to be calculated

# NOTE:
# Do not forget to import math library
# Output list is ascendingly sorted and
#   also contains 1 and n
# This is one of the slowest known method, so use
#   another method if you want to get factors of
#   large integers
