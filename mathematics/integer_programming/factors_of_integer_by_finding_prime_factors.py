# Function to get all factors of a positive
# integer by finding prime factors

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Before calling the main function fctrs_fpf(), generate
#   a list of primes prms containing primes more than sqrt
#   of number whose prime factors you want to compute
#   Use the provided function prm_ert_upto_n_lst() for this
#   This step needs to be done only once
# Then simply call pdvsrs() function with the number whose
#   prime factors are required

# NOTE:
# Do not forget to import math library
# Output list is ascendingly sorted and
#   also contains 1 and n
# It is safe to generate up to sqrt(n) but usually less
#   will also work. If it gives error that "index out of range" for
#   prms, that means you need to generate more prime numbers.
#   Sometimes prime numbers even up to sqrt(n) will also
#   not work, in which case make sure to generate one extra
#   prime number higher than sqrt(n) (this problem should mathematically
#   not be there, but exists due to floating number limitations)
# It uses recursion to generate n-tuples of prime factors to find all
#   factors, during which it uses "nonlocal" command that might not work
#   in Python 2, though an alternative of nonlocal should fix this
