# Functions to generate Pythagorean Triplets
# using Euclid's Formula

# Euclid's Formula is that for any positive integers m and n (m>n):
# the triplet (m**2 - n**2, 2*m*n, m**2 + n**2) is a
# Pythagorean Triplet. However, this formula does not produce
# all triplets for all values of m and n.
# To get all "primitive" triplets, we need that
# m>n, gcd(m,n)=1, m-n is odd
# and from these primitive triplets, one can get
# rest of the triplets by multiplying a factor k

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Call one of the pgts functions with required inputs:
#   Call pgts_1(m1, n1, k1) where m1, n1 and k1
#     are limits of m, n and k as described above,
#     these limits are not inclusive (as python's convention);
#     and so to get primitive triplets only, pass k1 = 2
#   Call pgts_h(hmx, ip) where hmx is limit on hypotenuse,
#     this limit is not inclusive (as python's convention),
#     and ip is (optional) logical variable, set it True if you
#     only want primitive triplets
#   Call pgts_p(pmx, ip) where pmx is limit on perimeter,
#     this limit is not inclusive (as python's convention),
#     and ip is (optional) logical variable, set it True if you
#     only want primitive triplets
#   Call pgts_a(amx, ip) where amx is limit on area,
#     this limit is not inclusive (as python's convention),
#     and ip is (optional) logical variable, set it True if you
#     only want primitive triplets

# NOTE:
# The output is not sorted
# int() is used on floats to determine some limits within
#   function, so it is possible limits to be incorrectly
#   calculated due to roundoff error; such an error occurs
#   in pgts_a() for amx = 31; if required, one can get rid
#   of such errors by checking difference between the
#   calculated float and its rounded integer, if difference
#   is very low (< 1.e-13 or so), then one can take rounded
#   number as limit instead of its int() value
