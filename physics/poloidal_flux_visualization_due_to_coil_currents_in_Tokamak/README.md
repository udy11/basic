## psiViz

This code computes poloidal flux (ψ) and poloidal magnetic field components (B_R, B_Z) due to poloidal coil currents in an axisymmetric Tokamak. The poloidal coil currents can be varied and changes in ψ, B_R and B_Z can be visualized live. Optionally, a D-shaped plasma can be added and its combined effect can also be observed. Please note that the ψ, B_R and B_Z computed from this code is not equivalent to the ones obtained from an MHD Equilibrium code, but it only provides a gross visualization of the expected profiles. It can also be helpful to estimate initial guess values of coil currents for inverse MHD Equilibrium codes. All quantities are in SI units unless specifically mentioned (like input coil currents that are in Mega Ampere).

I intend to keep it updated with latest versions of libraries. The code should inform about any missing library, perhaps except ipympl, so install it if the code does not work. If you encounter any error or has any feedback, please contact me.
