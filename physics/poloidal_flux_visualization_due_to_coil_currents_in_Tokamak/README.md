## psiViz

This code computes poloidal flux (ψ) and poloidal magnetic field components (B_R, B_Z) due to poloidal coil currents in an axisymmetric Tokamak. The poloidal coil currents can be varied and changes in ψ, B_R and B_Z can be visualized live. Optionally, a D-shaped plasma can be added and its combined effect can also be observed. Please note that the ψ, B_R and B_Z computed from this code is not equivalent to the ones obtained from an MHD Equilibrium code, but it only provides a gross visualization of the expected profiles. All values are in SI units unless specifically mentioned (like input coil currents that are in Mega Ampere).

I intend to keep it updated with latest versions of libraries. If you encounter any error, please contact me.
